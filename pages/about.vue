          <h3>ABOUT US</h3>
          <p>
            Understanding Significant Films is a commentary site that focusses
            on films that have something particularly meaningful to say to us
            about contemporary society. Concentrating on a few dozen carefully
            chosen films a year from all over the planet, about two each month,
            the site begins by offering an informed analysis and interpretation
            of what these significant films tell us about what it is to be
            living in our times.
          </p>
          <h3>MORE ABOUT US</h3>
          <p>
            After viewing certain films, we often are left with some questions
            and the feeling that there was more to the story than its script
            told us : was there a lesson to be learned; what did the film
            director want to tell us, or is that relevant; or ,was there no
            message or meaning at all ? Sometimes we would like to share those
            questions and our own understanding of the film with those of
            others. Alas, more often than not, our friends, family or colleagues
            have not viewed that specific film, and in fact have seen other
            films that we, ourselves, have not seen. So, with whom should we
            compare notes? Understanding Significant Films constitutes a partial
            but specific answer to these questions. It is a meeting place, a
            forum for initiating a conversation, a dialogue for the
            understanding of particularly significant and complex films of the
            world. All conversation or dialogue must begin with a specific
            statement. Understanding Significant Films thus begins, in this
            site, with an opening statement, in the form of a specific
            understanding and interpretation of the film that is under scrutiny.
            It gets, as it were, the ball rolling. Once an interpretation, an
            understanding, has been offered on this site, readers can join the
            conversation at XXXXXXXX, to read comments coming from others who
            have viewed that film, and eventually participate in the exchanges
            by offering an understanding or interpretations of their own. In
            offering a specific interpretation for a film, to get the ball
            rolling, as suggested earlier, we need some guidelines that are
            explicit and methodical, yet flexible enough to adapt to the
            understanding of the specific film under study. With these
            guidelines, we try to avoid the risk that our analysis,
            understanding and interpretation become only a wild speculation or a
            uniquely personal view of the film that has been viewed. And so, the
            next question becomes: is there a discipline, a tradition of sorts,
            that helps us navigate towards a better understanding of the film
            under scrutiny? We believe to have found such explicit yet flexible
            guidelines in the tradition of hermeneutics. Let us now introduce
            some of the elements of hermeneutics that will guide us for our
            opening analysis of the films we have chosen to work on.
          </p>
          <h3>STILL MORE ABOUT US</h3>
          <p>
            Understanding Significant Films proposes to begin the exchanges by
            using the hermeneutic approach, applied to films, to reach a better
            understanding of what can be considered as the larger story behind
            the specific and more limited story in the film.
            <br />The underlying assumption of this site, indeed, is that art,
            and films in particular, say a lot about where we are, today, in the
            human story. Hermeneutics is involved, indeed, in the search for
            understanding when a work of art (in our case, a film) tells us
            something about where we are today, collectively, but says it in an
            indirect and understated way. The object of this site is to follow
            this hermeneutic road to understand films that present some
            intriguing and challenging elements which demand interpretation for
            a fuller understanding. The 1653 painting of Rembrandt, “Aristotle
            contemplating a bust of Homer”, represent the a visual model of what
            we want to achieve in this site: the poet (or, in our case, the
            filmmaker) tells a story, but the philosopher (in our case the
            interpreter or analyst of the film) offers an understandings that
            may go beyond the story that is told in the film and beyond the
            intentions of the creator (of filmmaker). <br />This site is not
            about the aesthetics of a film or its artistic merit. Again taking
            Rembrandt’s painting as an example and inspiration (see the painting
            shown on this site), Aristotle is not presumed to comment critically
            on Homer’s style of writing. In keeping with this spirit, not once
            will we comment on the artistic or creative aspects of a film (its
            photography or acting for example). Neither is our goal to take a
            moral or political stand on the film under study, taking it as an
            opportunity for criticizing capitalism or globalization for example.
            Our only goal is to understand what is challenging but also telling
            about a film and its social significance. <br />We assume however
            that the films we choose are significant and telling about the times
            we live in. <br />More can be read on the hermeneutic method in our
            capsules entitled “A few words on hermeneutics” and “More on
            hermeneutics”.

          <h3>A FEW WORDS ON HERMENEUTICS</h3>
          <p>
            Hermeneutics is involved in the study and art of interpretation. The
            origins of the word “hermeneutic” is somewhat disputed, and
            sometimes its origins are associated with the role of Hermes, the
            Greek messenger of the gods, bringing messages to humans.
            Hermeneutics were at the very outset, and still are today, concerned
            with the deciphering of challenging or unclear texts. And so, at
            first, hermeneutics were involved, above all and almost exclusively,
            with written texts, most often religious or legal texts. But French
            hermeneutic philosopher Paul Ricoeur extended hermeneutics’ domain
            to “text like” creations or human productions, which includes, for
            example, architecture, paintings and most of the artistic
            expressions, including, in our case, films and cinema.
          </p>
          <h3>MORE ON HERMENEUTICS</h3>
          <p>
            In this section, we want to move deeper into understanding films
            through the use of hermeneutics. Stated broadly, hermeneutics
            concerns the art and method of interpretation, as we stated earlier.
            It has of course many dimensions and applications. Its application
            to films is part of the larger tradition of applying hermeneutics to
            artistic creations. Seen in this light, art is not only a question
            of aesthetics, but it participates in the search for knowledge. More
            specifically, in our case, knowledge about society and its many
            contemporary dimensions. Let us now look at how the need to better
            understand challenging and significant films leads us to
            hermeneutics. In a sense, all films speak about the human story but,
            on this site, we want to concentrate on some of those films that
            appear to us as particularly significant in this regard. Among those
            numerous films that speak to us in a significant way, we want to
            concentrate on those films where part of the content is presented
            somewhat indirectly and needs to be deciphered, beyond our immediate
            understanding. The story that is told in the film has some quite
            explicit aspects, while, at the same time, leaving some important
            elements understated or implicit. These implicit but important
            aspects become, as it were, the elephant behind the screen, and they
            are not as much hidden as they are in need of interpretation, in
            need of additional work for the spectator. Such is the hermeneutic
            approach in understanding significant films. The additional work
            required for the spectator, or the analyst, is often to find a
            common thread in the story, a common thread that is not explicit at
            the outset. The additional understanding sheds light on the story,
            often by tying together elements that seem, at first glance,
            unrelated. Finding a significant unity in certain films, beyond
            their first reading, is the task we want to respond to in this film
            site. Then, an effort is made to tie this understated meaning to
            contemporary society and to the human story, as it unfolds in the
            twenty first century.

          <h3>WHAT THIS FILM SITE IS NOT</h3>
          <p>
            Before going Before going further in describing what this site,
            Understanding Significant Films, is about, let us say a few words
            about what it is not. First, it is not about the intention of the
            author, screen writer, filmmaker or director. There is indeed no
            search about the intentions of the artist, of the writer or of the
            creator. We are interested in the outcome, the film itself, and
            believe that the film has a meaning beyond its creator, as the
            artists are not necessarily conscious of the richness of their
            creation. We are, on the other hand, very much interested in the
            opinion of the artist or film maker concerning his creation, but we
            are not tied by it. In this spirit, we want to draw, again, the
            reader’s attention to Rembrandts’ painting of 1653 “ Aristotle
            contemplating a bust of Homer”(shown on this site), where the Greek
            philosopher Aristotle puts his hands on the head of Homer,
            suggesting that Aristotle will interpret and add to Homer’s
            rendition of Greek history. The film’s analyst- interpreter plays
            the role of Aristotle trying to understand more fully what Homer-
            the artist-creator- is expressing. In the view taken here, the
            ultimate creator of the work of art, or story, can be seen as
            society itself, and that story needs deciphering, beyond the work of
            the creator-artist. Second, this site is not, as stated elsewhere,
            about the aesthetic dimension of films. Not once, will there be
            comments about the aesthetic qualities or weaknesses of the film,
            the quality of its photography or the work of its actors, for
            example. There are many sites and critics that address these
            important dimensions, but that will not be the focus here. We of
            course recognize that there are significant links between the style
            and the content of a film, but those links will not be the focus
            here. Thirdly, there is no attempt here to analyze a film through
            some sort of explicit and pre-established formal procedure, whether
            semiotics or some other formal method. Hermeneutics is essentially a
            general guide and inspiration, not a detailed technique. No attempt,
            either, to espouse some militant or politically charged sub-text,
            conscious or not, criticising capitalism or globalization for
            example, as stated earlier. Such films will not be part of those
            looked at in this site. There are other venues for such political
            analyses of cinema production. After identifying some of the
            elements our site is not about, let us identify some of the elements
            that inspire us and discipline our approach.
          </p>
          <h3>FOUNDATIONS FOR FILMS FOR THOUGHT</h3>
          <p>
            Let us come back to hermeneutics, the study and art of
            interpretation, as the main basis of the commentaries we offer on
            films on this site. While being attentive to the risk of too much
            interpretation, taken too far, we nevertheless think that artistic
            creation has something to say to us about the human experience,
            beyond its aesthetic dimension, as suggested earlier. German
            philosopher Georg H. Gadamer, a specialist on hermeneutics, had
            criticized in his long and distinguished career the tendency to see
            art as only a question of aesthetics. Art is indeed, according to
            Gadamer, also a source of knowledge about society, more specifically
            about the contemporary human experience. As artist, the filmmaker
            himself does not always plan to present this knowledge deliberately,
            as we suggested earlier. That is not a problem, quite the opposite,
            because there is a certain degree of unconsciousness in all artistic
            creation. The role of the hermeneutic process, on the other hand, is
            to bring to a greater level of consciousness this meaning when this
            meaning is difficult to identify. There is no need for the
            application of the hermeneutic method when, at one end of a
            continuum, the meaning is clear, or when, at the other end of the
            continuum, there is an overabundance of overcharged symbols and
            metaphors, going in all directions, obscuring the content of the
            film under study. There are other foundational elements which
            inspire our site, Understanding Significant Film. We referred
            earlier to the contribution of French hermeneutics philosopher Paul
            Ricoeur, and specifically to his suggestion that we include in the
            hermeneutic work “text like” creations, which opened the door to
            consider films and cinema as objects of hermeneutic interpretation.
            There is another important contribution from Paul Ricoeur that is
            pertinent for our purposes here. It concerns Ricoeurs’s idea that,
            when interpreting a text or a text like object under scrutiny, we
            often do not start with a completely clean slate. Sometimes, maybe
            most of the times, we have an idea of what we are trying to find, a
            sort of preliminary understanding of what we are looking for. He
            calls this preunderstanding the hermeneutics of “suspicion”, as
            opposed to the case when we look at something with a completely open
            mind, which he calls the hermeneutics of “openness”. The
            hermeneutics of suspicion, as a starting point, is neither worse nor
            better than the hermeneutics of openness, they are only different.
            The preunderstanding of the hermeneutics of suspicion is not
            necessarily problematic, since our preliminary understanding can be
            useful if kept in check and abandoned when it proves false or
            misleading. Many other hermeneutic philosophers have given attention
            to this process of preunderstanding, and Gadamer and his own
            teacher, Martin Heidegger, have pointed out that this process is
            unavoidable and must be recognized. In this spirit, we want to make
            explicit some the basic elements that constitute our own
            preunderstanding of the films we look at in this commentary site on
            cinema. First, it must be said that the author of this site comes
            from what is called the humanities and the social sciences, more
            specifically from political science, sociology and economics. In the
            preunderstanding of the films we choose to look at, we indeed
            believe that the film cannot escape the context or the times in
            which it is created. It can only reflect the times that give birth
            to its creation, whether the film portrays the present, the past or
            the future. More specifically, a film reveals something of the
            socio-economic context in which it appears. All through the
            twentieth century, and beyond, the history of cinema, starting at
            the same time as the twentieth century itself, was witness to all
            manner of historic, social and economic changes, reflecting, among
            other changes, the greater reach of our communication medias and the
            growing size and scale of human organizations, from village, to
            growing city, to nations, and to globalization, and possibly moving
            to smaller scale again. When looking at the films we choose to spend
            time on, which are not chosen randomly of course, we are mindful of
            these socio-economic dynamics, not to judge them or take positions
            on them, but only to better describe them and understand them.
            Ideally, the story that the films tells is related to the evolving
            human story of where we are, as humans, at this time in history.
            Films can be seen as chapters in a series about our collective human
            story. In trying to understand these socio-economic and historic
            aspects, we rely on some specific disciplines that, together, make
            up the elements of our preunderstanding and our own hermeneutics of
            suspicion. Drawing from sociology, we are guided by some aspect of
            its interpretative (or interpretive) and historical tradition, found
            among others in the work of Max Weber. In economics, we are mostly
            interested in Economic Institutionalism, a school very much
            interested in the changes brought by evolving patterns of human and
            economic interactions. Finally, from a media history point of view,
            the work of Canadian media philosopher Marshall McLuhan (« the
            global village » and « the medium is the message ») is for us an
            important source of understanding. As stated earlier, it is in
            keeping with many hermeneutic analyses to recognize that there is a
            kind of pre-understanding, possibly abandoned later, in any effort
            at understanding. We have just exposed some elements of our own
            pre-understanding in referring to interpretative sociology,
            institutional economics and McLuhan theories on the history of
            media. There are other sources for understanding films in this site,
            but the ones just mentioned can be considered as the principal ones.
